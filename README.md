# Python
EXERCISE 8.1
Create the following NumPy arrays:
(a) float from 0.0 to 1.0 step 0.1, shape=(11,),
(b) int zeros (1 byte) with shape=(5,6),
(c) complex with shape=(9,), powers of x = complex(0, 1): 1, x, x**2, ..., x**8.

EXERCISE 8.2
(a) Create an arbitrary one dimensional array called v1.
(b) Create a new array v2 which consists of the odd indices of v1.
(c) Create a new array v3 in backwards ordering from v1.

EXERCISE 8.3
(a) Create a two dimensional array called m1, shape=(4,5).
(b) Create a new array m2 from m1, in which the elements of each row are in reverse order.
(c) Create a new array m3 from m1, in which the elements of each column are in reverse order.
(d) Cut of the first and last row and the first and last column of m1.
