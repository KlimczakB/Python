## EXERCISE 9.1 (PLOT)
Plot functions sin(x), cos(x), and exp(-x) in a range [0,10].

Colors are red, green, and blue, respectively. 

Lines are solid, dashed, and dotted, respectively. 

Add a legend.

## EXERCISE 9.2 (SCATTER)
Generate n=100 random points in a unit square [0,1]x[0,1]. 

Points are green if the distance from (0,0) is less then 1; they are red otherwise. 

The marker area of a point (x,y) should be proportional to x+y.
